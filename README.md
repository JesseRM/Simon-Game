# Simon-Game
A Simon game with a with a built in menu. The traditional Simon game requires that sounds and the lighting up of pads run in a certain sequence after a certain amount of time.  The purpose of the project was to begin understand how to run a sequence of operations in JavaScript using methods such as `seInterval` `setTimeout` `clearInterval`.  I also wanted to add a bit of functionality by adding a menu where the user could select a difficulty.

## Usage
[Live Demo](https://jesserm.github.io/Simon-Game/)

Click on the power button to "boot" up the game and then click the "play" button to begin a round. 

The settngs menu offers three difficulty settings:
  1. Easy - Normal speed
  2. Hard - Faster speed
  3. Extreme - Faster speed and pads spin
  
Enabling "Strict" mode will cause a new sequence to start if the user hits a wrong pad.

## Technologies
1. JavaScript
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. Bootstrap

## Project Status
As this is a beginner project the code for the most part will remain as is.  The main goal was to complete the core functionality of the game which has been done.  An incomplete feature of the game is the ablilty to mute the sound as will be noticed by the user as the "sound" button does nothing.
